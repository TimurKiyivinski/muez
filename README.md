# MUEZ
A lightweight search-oriented app drawer only Android Launcher.

## features
- web search
- application search
- alphabetical scrolling

### web search note
Web search only supports search in applications that support the `ACTION_WEB_SEARCH` intent such as Google Search.
I have made a PR to DuckDuckGo Search & Stories for Android to implement it [here](https://github.com/duckduckgo/android-search-and-stories/issues/286), though it does not seem to have been included in any recent release. If you want to use DuckDuckGo you will have to compile it yourself.
